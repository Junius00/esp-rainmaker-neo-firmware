 * @brief Matter mirror: derive a Matter data model from the RainMaker Neo data model
 *        and keep the two in sync.
 *
 * The RainMaker Neo param store remains the single canonical state store; the mirror
 * lowers the node's devices/params into an esp-matter endpoint/cluster tree
 * (per the compiled-in mapping tables) and reflects state changes both ways:
 * cloud/app/schedule-originated changes appear on the Matter fabric, and
 * Matter controller commands are delivered to the device's regular RainMaker Neo write
 * callback (with source ESP_RMAKER_REQ_SRC_EXTERNAL).
