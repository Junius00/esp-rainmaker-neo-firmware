# Matter Light

A colour smart light that is a plain ESP RainMaker Neo node to the cloud and an
**Extended Color Light** to a Matter fabric. Power, brightness, hue, saturation,
colour temperature (CCT) and light mode are controllable from the ESP RainMaker
Home app, from the cloud, and from any Matter controller on the fabric.

## On-device behavior

- **LED** (on-board RGB LED, present on most ESP dev boards) shows the current
  light state.
- **Colour spaces** — the light tracks either HSV or CCT and switches
  automatically: changing hue/saturation switches to HSV, changing CCT switches
  to CCT. Any colour change in the active mode also turns the light on.
- **Button** (BOOT button by default):
  - **Short press** — toggle power.
  - **Long press** — set a random colour temperature (2700–6500 K).
- **Identify** — a Matter controller can ask the light to identify itself. The
  LED then blinks for the requested duration.

Both sides stay in sync. A change from the cloud, the app or a schedule appears
on the Matter fabric, and a controller command lands in the same callback the
cloud uses.

## Before you flash

**A factory partition is mandatory for this firmware.** Assisted claiming does
not apply to a Matter node, so this example disables it. One `fctry` partition
carries both stacks: the Matter credentials (DAC, PAI, CD, commissioning
passcode and discriminator) and the RainMaker credentials.

Obtain the factory partition binary from your deployment's dashboard, then flash
it at this example's `fctry` offset before you flash the firmware. The offsets
and step-by-step instructions are in the README shown on the Launchpad landing
page.

> Commercial ecosystems validate the attestation chain. A device built with test
> DAC/PAI/CD material is only accepted by a controller that allows test
> credentials.

## After flashing

This build onboards through Matter commissioning. There is no RainMaker
provisioning session — the Wi-Fi credentials arrive over Matter. The node ends
up on two fabrics, and the factory QR code starts both commissionings.

1. Open the **ESP RainMaker Home** app.
2. Scan the QR code of the factory partition. The app commissions its own fabric
   first, then the RainMaker fabric, back to back.
3. Control the light from the app and from your Matter controller.

To commission from another Matter app first (Apple Home, Google Home, Alexa,
Home Assistant), let that app take the first fabric. Then open a pairing window
from it and commission the RainMaker fabric from ESP RainMaker Home.
